This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start-dev`

Launches a dev server watching the unbuilt files live.<br />

### `npm test`

Launches the Jest test suites while file-watching.<br />

Use the options '-- --coverage --watchAll=false' to generate a code coverage report.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run start`

Launches the app from the build folder. This will not live-update, run build in order to see updates.
