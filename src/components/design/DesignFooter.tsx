                            The Avian Database Project, envisioned by Professor Allen Hurlbert
                            of UNCâ€™s Department of Biology, provides user-friendly access
                            to the data Prof. Hurlbert and his team collect on avian diet
                            from various studies. This is one of the largest collections on
                            this subject, with over 56,000 records up to date.

                            This type of data is of interest to many different types people
                            like scientist, ecologists, hobbyists, or just the curious.
                            Prof. Hurlbert himself also would love use this project to explore
                            through the database. Whether the scientist and the ecologist want
                            to explore how climate and land changes affect bird species and their
                            prey over time, or whether the hobbyist and the curious simply want
                            to know the diet of specific species, there are many users who would
                            benefit from being able to explore the data.

                            However, getting relevant information from the current database is
                            not easy or straightforward, but requires some technical skill.

                            This project addresses this problem and provides a solution by
                            aiming to create a desktop and mobile-friendly website that allows
                            the beforementioned users to explore the database in an intuitive
                            manner and provides easy to digest visualizations. This includes
                            new ways to query data, easy-to-apply filters, search functionalities
                            , and graphical data summaries.
